🧩 Problem Statement
In today’s fast-paced digital world, creators and marketers often struggle to generate high-quality content quickly across multiple formats — whether it's text, images, videos, or social media posts. The process is fragmented, time-consuming, and lacks personalization.
This project aims to solve that by building a unified, AI-powered content creation tool using Unity and Firebase. After logging in, users can select the type of content they want to create (e.g., image, video, LinkedIn post, blog intro), specify key attributes like target audience and tone, and instantly generate tailored outputs using GenAI models like Perplexity or ChatGPT.
The goal is to simplify and accelerate content generation for creators, marketers, and startups — all within a clean, interactive interface that adapts to user needs.


🚀 Solution Overview
We are building a cross-platform content creation app using Unity that empowers users to generate high-quality digital assets — including text, images, and social media posts — with the help of AI.

🔐 Authentication & Data
- Users log in securely using Firebase Authentication.
- User data and preferences are stored using Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore, enabling personalized experiences and session continuity.

🧠 AI Integration
- The app connects directly to AI APIs (such as Perplexity or OpenAI) to generate content based on user inputs.
- Users can specify content type (e.g., image, video, LinkedIn post), target audience, tone, and format.
- The backend securely handles API keys and forwards user prompts to the AI model, returning tailored responses.

🎮 Unity Frontend
- Built entirely in Unity, the app features a clean, interactive UI.
- Dropdowns and input fields allow users to customize their content requests.
- Results are displayed instantly, making the experience fast and intuitive.
This solution combines Unity’s flexibility with Firebase’s scalability and AI’s creativity — enabling rapid, personalized content generation for creators, marketers, and startups.
